1. June(75°F) is average 4°F higher than Dec (71°F), but much drier(or less precipitation) in June (0.13 inches) compare to December(0.21 inches)

The line graph presents temperature in June that is more consistant compare to December and have flat distribution. Meanwhile the graph of December have great decrease in both end where the graph shapes symmetric.

Additional query of June temperature by percipitation shows temperature and percipitation have faily symmetrical relationship while having high percipitation on 68°F, and querry of December temperature by percipitation shows right skewed distribution with wider range of percipitation distribution along the temperature. 

## Summary

The main concern of W.Avy was whether the business is year-around sustainable. The temperature data shows the average temperature around June and December which had no considerable amount of temp differences. Additionally, from the additional query, the relation between temp and pcrp in both June and December isn't strongly skewed except for few outliers in Dec data. Thus, the analysis supports business to be sustainable year-around.
